 Using JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack Conference. Adding my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity. Also, by validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
